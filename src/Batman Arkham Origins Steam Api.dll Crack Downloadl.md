## What are the critics saying about Batman Arkham Origins?
 
Batman Arkham Origins is the third installment in the popular Arkham series, but it's not developed by Rocksteady Studios, the creators of the previous two games. Instead, it's handled by Warner Bros. Games Montreal, who have tried to replicate the formula of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, with mixed results. The game is set five years before the events of Arkham Asylum, and follows a younger and less experienced Batman as he faces eight deadly assassins on Christmas Eve. The game also features Batman's first encounter with his arch-nemesis, The Joker.
 
But how does the game compare to its predecessors? And does it offer anything new or innovative to the franchise? Here's a summary of some of the reviews from various gaming websites and publications:

- **IGN**: 7.8/10. "It's as good as Batman: Arkham City in most ways, having inherited an outstanding combat system, but it lacks interesting ideas of its own, and it's missing the polish and attention to detail that makes Arkham City and Arkham Asylum great action games."[^2^]
- **PC Gamer**: 68/100. "Enjoyable in places and very pretty, but sadly blighted by sloppy design, terrible boss battles, and a lack of new ideas."[^3^]
- **Nintendo Life**: 6/10. "Batman: Arkham Origins is the tricky type of game that isnât innately bad, but it recycles so much from its predecessors and does absolutely nothing to improve upon them. The gameplay is uninspired, the graphics are a bit shaky, and the plot tries to do too much and ends up being too sloppy to make any real sense."[^4^]
- **CNET**: 3.5/5. "Arkham Origins is a solid Batman game that has moments of greatness, but it doesn't do much to push the series any further. The moments in Origins that feel familiar tend to dominate the entire experience."[^5^]
- **GameSpot**: 6/10. "Batman: Arkham Origins is a deeply predictable game. It gives you exactly what you'd expect in another Arkham game, without doing anything to push the series forward."[^1^]

As you can see, most critics agree that Batman Arkham Origins is a decent game that follows the same formula of its predecessors, but fails to deliver anything fresh or innovative. Some also complain about technical issues, such as bugs and glitches, that affect the gameplay and immersion. The game does have some positive aspects, such as the voice acting, the combat system, and some of the story missions, but they are not enough to make it stand out from the crowd.
 
If you are a fan of the Arkham series and want more of the same, you might enjoy Batman Arkham Origins. But if you are looking for something new or different, you might want to skip this one and wait for Rocksteady's next project.
