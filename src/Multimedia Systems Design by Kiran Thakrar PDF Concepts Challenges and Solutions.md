## An Introduction to Multimedia Systems
 
The book starts with an overview of multimedia systems and their applications. The authors define multimedia systems as systems that can handle multiple types of media, such as text, graphics, audio, video, and animation, and provide interactive and rich user experiences. The authors also describe some of the common applications of multimedia systems, such as education, entertainment, business, and communication. The authors then introduce some of the key concepts and terms related to multimedia systems, such as media elements, media integration, media synchronization, media quality, media interactivity, and media scalability.
 
## Compression and Decompression Techniques for Multimedia Data
 
The book then explains the need for compression and decompression techniques for multimedia data. The authors point out that multimedia data are usually large in size and require a lot of storage space and bandwidth for transmission. Therefore, compression and decompression techniques are used to reduce the size of multimedia data without compromising their quality. The authors describe some of the common compression and decompression techniques for different types of media, such as lossless and lossy compression, run-length encoding, Huffman coding, arithmetic coding, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm, JPEG algorithm, MPEG algorithm, and H.261 algorithm.
 
## Data and File Format Standards for Multimedia Data
 
The book then discusses the data and file format standards for multimedia data. The authors explain that data and file format standards are used to specify the structure and representation of multimedia data. Data and file format standards enable interoperability and compatibility among different multimedia systems and devices. The authors describe some of the common data and file format standards for different types of media, such as ASCII code, Unicode code, bitmap format (BMP), graphics interchange format (GIF), portable network graphics (PNG), tagged image file format (TIFF), joint photographic experts group (JPEG) format, moving picture experts group (MPEG) format, audio interchange file format (AIFF), waveform audio file format (WAV), musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) format, real-time transport protocol (RTP), hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), and scalable vector graphics (SVG).
