## Method 1: Using the VALUE Function
 
The VALUE function in Excel can convert a text string that represents a number into a numeric value. For example, if you have a serial number formatted as text like "123-456-789", you can use the VALUE function to convert it to 123456789.
 
To use the VALUE function, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a blank cell where you want to enter the formula.
2. Type =VALUE( and select the cell that contains the formatted serial number.
3. Close the parenthesis and press Enter.
4. Copy the formula down to other cells if needed.

The VALUE function will remove any non-numeric characters from the serial number and return a numeric value. You can then format the result as a number or any other format you prefer.
  
## Method 2: Using the Text to Columns Feature
 
The Text to Columns feature in Excel can split a text string into multiple columns based on a delimiter or a fixed width. For example, if you have a serial number formatted as text like "123-456-789", you can use the Text to Columns feature to split it into three columns based on the hyphen (-) delimiter.
 
To use the Text to Columns feature, follow these steps:

1. Select the cells that contain the formatted serial numbers.
2. Go to the Data tab and click on Text to Columns.
3. In the Text to Columns Wizard, choose Delimited and click Next.
4. In the Delimiters section, check the box for Other and type - in the box next to it. Click Next.
5. In the Column data format section, choose General and click Finish.

The Text to Columns feature will split the serial numbers into three columns based on the hyphen delimiter. You can then concatenate the columns using the & operator or use another formula to combine them into one column.
  
## Method 3: Using the Paste Special Feature
 
The Paste Special feature in Excel can perform various operations on copied data, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing. For example, if you have a serial number formatted as text like "123-456-789", you can use the Paste Special feature to multiply it by 1 and convert it to a numeric value.
